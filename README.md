# **Library Management System**

## Problem Definition
Managing a library's extensive collection of books manually is challenging and prone to errors.
Issues such as misplaced books, inefficient tracking of borrowed books, and difficulties in
maintaining user records can significantly hinder library operations. 

## Description
A full-stack Library Management System project, utilizing React, JavaScript, Spring Boot, and MySQL. This system offers a comprehensive user experience, particularly tailored for students. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the features:<br/>
**Student Registration and Login:** Students can easily register and log in to access their personalized profiles.<br/>
**Profile Management:** Once logged in, students can view their profile, which includes a button to explore various book categories like Science Fiction and more.<br/>
**Book Browsing and Selection:** Students can browse through the different book categories and view a list of books available in each category. They have the option to add books of interest to their profile.<br/>
**Personalized Book List:** The added books are displayed in the studentâ€™s profile. If a book is no longer needed, the student can easily delete it from their list.<br/>
**CRUD Operations:** The system efficiently handles Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, ensuring smooth data management and user interaction.<br/>
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate frontend and backend technologies to create a seamless and interactive user experience. I'm excited to share this accomplishment and look forward to applying these skills to future projects.

 ## Solution Description
The LibraryManagementSystem addresses these issues by providing an automated and
userfriendly platform for library management. The system allows users to register and log in, and
provides features for adding, removing, and categorizing books. Managers have additional
capabilities to oversee the entire library inventory and user activities.
